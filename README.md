Some of the architectural, design consideration considered and furture consideration are as follows,

* Spring MVC
* MongoDB NoSQL document based DB
* Gradle as its faster than Maven, with much more feasible features
* Swagger implementations
* Spring Boot Actuator for Health, Traffic, Monitoring the app
* Microservice design

To be in future:

* Spring Cloud (As with more microservices, dev and monitoring would be feasible )
* Redis ( For cache managment as instead of api call would serve the request from cache which improves performance)
* Docker (For containerisation and quick deploy with minimal infra)
* Continous Intergration and Deployment using Jenkins and Nexus etc 
* AWS for scaling the infra and prod deployment etc
